Snappy is a software deployment and package management system developed by Canonical for the Linux operating system. The packages, called snaps, and the tool for using them, snapd, work across a range of Linux distributions allowing distribution-agnostic upstream software packaging. Snappy was originally designed for Ubuntu Touch. The system is designed to work for internet of things, cloud and desktop computing.Developers can use snaps to create command line tools and background services as well as desktop applications.[8] With snap applications, upgrades via atomic operation or by deltas are possible.
